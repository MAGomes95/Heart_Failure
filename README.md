# Heart_Failure
This repository holds my data science project implementation associated with this Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data

The challenge consists in predicting if a given patient will experiment a heart failure death event during a follow-up period.
The data available for this challenge is a dataset containg 299 patients characterized in 12 features.
